# Tips and tricks about the `Box` component

## You don't need the `classNames` helper as often now

The new `Box` component's `className` prop receives the same kind of values supported by this helper. So you can do things like this:

```jsx
// This…
<Box className={classNames(styles.container, 'custom-class-name')} />

// …can be written like this
<Box className={[styles.container, 'custom-class-name']} />

// Other examples:
<Box
  className={[
    styles.container,
    isReadOnly ? styles.readOnly : null,
    { [styles.disabled]: isDisabled },
  ]}
/>
```

Granted, this is only supported in the `Box`. This is because the `Box` is the only design system component that officially supports custom styles. Remember that for the other components you can use `exceptionallySetClassName`, but this one is an escape hatch, that we should aim to not use as much as the design system matures. So this one does not support that feature.

## The `paddingX` and `paddingY` shorthand props

The `Box` component has props to set its padding in all four direction: `paddingTop`, `paddingRight`, `paddingBottom`, `paddingLeft`. You have probably noticed that we can set them all at once with `padding`. But you might have missed the fact that we can set the padding in one of the two dimensions at once as well. This is achieved with `paddingX` (which sets `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight`) and `paddingY` (which sets `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom`).

```jsx
// A box with a large padding left and right, and a small padding top and bottom
<Box paddingX="large" paddingY="small" />
```

The same applies to the `margin*` props.
