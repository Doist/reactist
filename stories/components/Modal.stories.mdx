# Component Documentation

### How to use

---

The **Modal** component consists of four subcomponents _Box, Header, Body, Actions_ which are exported as keys of the Modal object. Hence, to use a Modal your code should look like this:

```
import { Modal } from 'reactist';
...
<Modal.Box>
    <Modal.Header>...</Modal.Header>
   <Modal.Body>...</Modal.Body>
    <Modal.Actions>...</Modal.Actions>
</Modal.Box>
```

The Modal is always attached to an element with the id **modal_box**. You need to add this somewhere in your component hierarchy in order for the Modal to work correctly. It is sufficient to add this once near the top of your component hierarchy.

### Modal Box

---

The **Modal.Box** component simply acts as a container for the Modal and is responsible for rendering the dark overlay and all children components. You can pass it an optional _className_ property to apply additional styles.

The **Modal.Box** accepts an optional property _closeOnOverlayClick_ when set to **true** a click on the overlay will close the modal. Defaults to **false**.

### Modal Header

---

The **Modal.Header** component shows the Header of the Modal. It always show a close icon on the right side to close the Modal. It can display arbitrary content you pass to it as children. However, the recommended usage pattern is to supply the _title_ and _subtitle_ (string) properties. This displays nicely formatted headings inside the Header.

Nevertheless, the **Modal.Header** will look the same whether you go for option 1 or option 2:

```
// Option 1
<Modal.Header>A Fancy Title</Modal.Header>;

// Option 2
<Modal.Header title='A Fancy Title' />;
```

### Modal Body

---

In the simplest case the **Modal.Body** just wraps all its children. However, it can be used to implement a more complex Dialog (i.e. if you do not want to render a Header). You can specify the _icon_ property (any node, e.g. an _&lt;img /&gt;_ or your custom _&lt;Icon /&gt;_ component) which will be displayed on the left side of the Dialog's Body. When you set the _showCloseIcon_ property to **true** the Body will display a close icon to dismiss the Dialog again. This should only be used when no Header is used.

### Modal Actions

---

The **Modal.Actions** displays an action bar on the bottom of the Modal. It works best with the Reactist Buttons. If you set the _close_ property to **true** on any of the supplied children it's _onClick_ function will close the modal.

```
<Modal.Actions>
    <Button variant="primary" close />;Clicking me will close the Modal</Button>
</Modal.Actions>
```
