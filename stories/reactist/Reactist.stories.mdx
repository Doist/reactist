## Welcome

Open source React components made with ❤️ by Doist.

## How to use

You can add Reactist to your project by installing it from npm:
`npm install @doist/reactist`
If you prefer to include static files, download the latest tarball from the [package page](https://github.com/Doist/reactist/packages/60435) and include the following files in your project:
`/dist/reactist.cjs.production.min.js`
`/styles/reactist.css`

A detailed explanation and examples on how to use each component can be accessed by clicking on the component name on the left.

## Development

First clone the repository to your local machine by running:
`git clone git@github.com:Doist/reactist.git`
We identified two major modes of development for Reactist. First, running an interactive storybook and see the changes you make to a component in an isolated environment. This is especially helpful when developing new components. And second, improving existing components in real-life applications.

#### Storybook

For the first development mode run:
`npm run storybook`
This boots up a development server with hot reloading on http://localhost:6006. You can iterate on the components in the existing stories or add a completely new one.

#### Inside your application

For the second development mode you can leverage
`npm link`
First run:
`npm run start`
this will update the build artifacts whenever you change something.
In your real application you need to first delete the current _@doist/reactist_ dependency and then link to your local one.

```
cd ~/your-app
# delete current reactist dependency
rm -rf ./node_modules/@doist/reactist

# link local reactist version
npm link ../reactist
```

The relative path to reactist may need to be changed to match your local environment.

To undo the changes and switch back to the reactist version from npm do the following:

```
cd ~/your-app
# first remove linked reactist dependency
rm -rf ./node_modules/@doist/reactist

# re-install reactist from npm (-E avoids updating the version / package-lock.json)
npm install -E @doist/reactist
```

### Development tips and tricks

Independent of the development you operate in to produce a new build (e.g. before submitting a PR) run:

```
npm run build
```

**Note:** This will **not** update the docs. In case you want to update the docs you need to run:

```
npm run build-storybook
```

You can run our eslint checks with

```
npm run check
```

It is mandatory to fix all linting errors before you make a pull request.

**Tip:** You can fix most of the errors automatically by running:

```
npm run check -- --fix
```

## Testing

Tests are executed with jest or by running:

```
npm run test
```

During development you may find it beneficial to continuously execute the tests. This works by running:

```
npm run test-watch
```

This also prints the current test coverage.

MacOS users might need to upgrade watchman with

```
brew install watchman
```

when experiencing troubles with the watch mode. See this issue for details: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1767
