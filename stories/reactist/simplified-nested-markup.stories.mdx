# Simplified markup of the `Stack` and `Inline` components

It's no secret that our layout components are inspired by [the ones in the Braid Design System](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/foundations/layout). One key difference in some of these components is that we simplified them to privilege simpler markup by default.

In Braid, for instance, `Stack` and `Inline` elements automatically generate an extra `div` wrapping each of its child elements. This allows them to achieve a full level of separation of concerns. You see, part of the layout duties of a `Stack` or an `Inline` component relies on applying certain styles to its child elements (e.g. to achieve the spacing they apply margin to the child elements). So they add this extra `div` around each child to make sure these styles are applied to these divs, and do not collide with the styles that the actual child element has.

This is all better illustrated by an example. Take this `Inline`, for instance:

```jsx
<Inline>
    <button type="button">Cancel</button>
    <button type="submit">Save</button>
</Inline>
```

In Braid, this component will render roughly the following markup:

```html
<div class="css classes for the inline container">
    <div class="css classes for the inline child wrapper">
        <button type="button">Cancel</button>
    </div>
    <div class="css classes for the inline child wrapper">
        <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </div>
</div>
```

In our design system, however, this is the markup that we'll generate:

```html
<div class="css classes for the inline container">
    <button type="button">Cancel</button>
    <button type="submit">Save</button>
</div>
```

Originally, our components were like that of Braid, but this issue was brought up internally, and we decided to make it simpler, even if it adds a burden to the consumer of these components. A burden that we need to be aware of. You can find more information about this change in [the PR that introduced it](https://github.com/Doist/reactist/pull/497). The concern is not ours alone, as it [was raised in Braid's own repo as well](https://github.com/seek-oss/braid-design-system/issues/386).

We explain below why this change made sense.

## Why we made the change

A good deal of the time, what we nest inside a `Stack` is already a block element. Also, we favour having components without outward margin in the out-most container. So **there's no concern that the margin that the `Stack` applies to its child elements will clash with the margin that the child elements themselves may have**. So it seems a waste of resources to have a UI language that could potentially generate lots of useless extra containers around a relatively simple UI.

### How it looks like with the extra container in place

Take, for instance, this example:

```jsx
<Stack space="xlarge">
    <Stack space="small">
        <label>Username</label>
        <input name="username" />
    </Stack>
    <Stack space="small">
        <label>Password</label>
        <input name="password" type="password" />
    </Stack>
</Stack>
```

If we generated extra containers for each child, this would generate a markup similar to what's shown below:

```html
<div class="stack space-xlarge">
  <div class="stack child-wrapper">
    <div class="stack space-small">
      <div class="stack child-wrapper">
        <label>Username</label>
      </div>
      <div class="stack child-wrapper">
        <input name="username" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="stack child-wrapper">
    <div class="stack space-small">
      <div class="stack child-wrapper">
        <label>Password</label>
      </div>
      <div class="stack child-wrapper">
        <input name="password" type="password" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And just imagine if inside the inner stack we rendered a `Inline` element, which also did the same for its child elements.

### How it looks like without the extra container element

```html
<div class="stack space-xlarge">
    <div class="stack space-small">
        <label>Username</label>
        <input name="username" />
    </div>
    <div class="stack space-small">
        <label>Password</label>
        <input name="password" type="password" />
    </div>
</div>
```

## Why do you need to know all this

This change comes with a caveat: depending on what child element you use, this way in which it all works may cause trouble.

The exact situations are not fully documented yet. But if you find yourself having trouble with some elements inside `Stack` or `Inline`, consider wrapping them manually in a `<div>` or `<Box>` yourself, and see if it fixes your issue. As we find concrete examples, we can add them to this documentation.

For instance, this could happen if you pass to a `Stack` a component that renders a fragment with more than one child in it. Depending on what you expect, you may not get what you want. For instance, given this component:

```jsx
function List() {
    return (
        <>
            <header>List</header>
            <ul>â€¦</ul>
        </>
    )
}
```

If you pass this element into a `Stack`, it will consider each of the two child elements (the `header` and the `ul`) to be individual items in the stack, and will apply spacing into it. This is arguably not what you want. Technically, the `Stack` is reaching out into the internals of this component and possibly breaking its own layout.

There are easy ways around this. Either do not return a fragment, or wrap this element in an extra container manually when put inside a `Stack`. Or maybe this is what you wanted in a particular case, in which case you got what you wanted.
