# Contributing to Reactist

First of all a big thank you for your interest in Reactist and your desire to contribute. It's really appreaciated ❤️

## Getting Started

Our [README](../README.md) should contain all information to get you started. If you have problems with setting up Reactist or running tests please feel free to file an issue.

## What do you want to do?

Do you want to work on an existing issue?

-   Leave a comment on the issue saying that you start working on it.

Do you want to add a new component?

-   Create an issue describing the component and we'll tell you whether it's a good fit for Reactist (most of them will be so don't be shy 😊). After that you can start working on it.

Did you find a bug or a component not behaving as expected?

-   Create an issue describing the problem. Either we will fix this or give you the opportunity (and help) to fix it yourself.

Any other question / feedback?

-   Open an issue and let us know :)

## Struggling during development or need help?

Open an issue - we're happy to help you with your Reactist-related problems 😊
